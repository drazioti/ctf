Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are exciting and informative events in the world of cybersecurity. They provide a space where people can improve their hacking abilities safely. With the rise of more complex cybersecurity threats, it's increasingly important to have skilled experts in this area. A European project focused on improving cybersecurity skills and knowledge is incorporating CTF challenges as a key part of its efforts.

In SecurEU we shall utilize CTFs as a pivotal educational tool, promoting them as an effective and engaging way to learn about cybersecurity. The initiative seeks to attract a diverse group of participants, from students to professionals, encouraging them to dive into the world of cybersecurity and develop their skills. By participating in these competitions, individuals can gain practical experience, enhance their understanding of security principles, and prepare themselves to better tackle the cyber challenges of tomorrow.
